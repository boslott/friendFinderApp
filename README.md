### Design Process

* The App's UI is based around a [StartBootStrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com) template. 

* The App first draws the user in, sends the user through a short journey of education as to what and why the App is all about

* The App then sends the user to the short questionaire

* After answering the questions, the App shows the user a new friend via a popup Modal
